# MNIST Digit Classification

This project demonstrates the use of various machine learning models for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The models implemented include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Neural Networks (NN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Transfer Learning with VGG16 and ResNet50. Additionally, an ensemble method combining the predictions of these models is explored.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is used, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9). Each image is 28x28 pixels in grayscale.

## Training and Evaluation

The models were trained on the MNIST training set and evaluated on the test set. The training was done over 10 epochs, and the performance was measured using accuracy. The CNN and NN models showed high accuracy, with CNN slightly outperforming the others.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mnist-digit-classification.git
    cd mnist-digit-classification
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Notebook**:
    Open `mnist_digit_classification.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab and run the cells to train and evaluate the models.

## Insights

- **CNN Performance**: The CNN model achieved the highest accuracy due to its ability to capture spatial hierarchies in images through convolutional layers.
- **Data Augmentation**: Introducing data augmentation techniques like rotation, shifting, and zooming can further enhance model performance.
- **Transfer Learning**: VGG16 and ResNet50 showed that even pre-trained models can effectively classify handwritten digits with relatively high accuracy.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combining multiple models can lead to improved performance, as seen with the ensemble method achieving an accuracy of 98.92%.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of various machine learning models for image classification tasks. The CNN model, in particular, proves to be highly effective for the MNIST digit classification task. Future work could involve experimenting with more advanced data augmentation techniques, hyperparameter tuning, and exploring other ensemble methods.
